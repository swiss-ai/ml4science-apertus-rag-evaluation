Meeus selected for the 2025 CAS Future Leaders™ program\nHonours and prizes\nEva J. Meeus, post-doctoral student in the Morandi Group at ETH Zurich, has been selected for the global CAS Future Leaders program – a prestigious and highly competitive program that provides opportunities for early career scientists to learn leadership skills and engage in scientific discourse.\n08.04.2025\nWhat if researchers looking for life on exoplanets find nothing?\nAstronomy\nIn the search for exoplanet life, could finding nothing at all still mean something? Physicist, Daniel Angerhausen, ETH Zurich's Institute of Particle Physics and Astrophysics, led a team of researchers in a study to find out what humanity could learn about the universe - even if no signs of life on other planets is detected.\n07.04.2025\nWhy banks (don't) keep their net-zero promises: A reality check\nGlobally, banks have committed to net-zero emissions in their investment and lending activities by 2050, but the likelihood of them reaching pledged emission reductions is unclear. Without regulatory backing, effective implementation of voluntary climate pledges is prevented by banks' fear of suffering market disadvantages,  as a study by ETH Zurich shows.\n03.04.2025\nSee more news\nFooter\nRecommended links\nMedia information\nSearch\nKeyword or person\nFollow us\nServices\nStudent portal\nAlumni association\nStaffnet\nContact\nLogin\nDepartments\nD-ARCH\nArchitecture\nD-BAUG\nCivil, Environmental and Geomatic Engineering\nD-BIOL\nBiology\nD-BSSE\nBiosystems Science and Engineering\nD-CHAB\nChemistry and Applied Biosciences\nD-EAPS\nEarth and Planetary Sciences\nD-GESS\nHumanities, Social and Political Sciences\nD-HEST\nHealth Sciences and Technology\nD-INFK\nComputer Science\nD-ITET\nInformation Technology and Electrical Engineering\nD-MATH\nMathematics\nD-MATL\nDepartment of Materials\nD-MAVT\nMechanical and Process Engineering\nD-MTEC\nManagement, Technology and Economics\nD-PHYS\nPhysics\nD-USYS\nEnvironmental Systems Science\nTable of contents and legal\nSitemap\nImprint\nAccessibility Statement\nDisclaimer & Copyright\nData protection\n© 2025  Eidgenössische\nTechnische Hochschule Zürich\nJavaScript has been disabled in your browser", "source_warc": "ARCHIVEIT-19945-WEEKLY-JOB2538523-SEED3004629-20250410105708162-00000-h3.warc.gz"}
