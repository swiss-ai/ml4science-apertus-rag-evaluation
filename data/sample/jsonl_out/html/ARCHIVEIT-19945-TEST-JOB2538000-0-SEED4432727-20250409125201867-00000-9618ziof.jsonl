It was founded in 2017 by Jonathan Benhamu to answer the question: How can technology support architectural design (Entwurf).\nWe realized that in architectural design, digital tools are often used reluctantly by established architects, as they were seen as a threat to conventional tools such as drawing on paper and hand-made models. Yet, we think that it must not be a decision between digital or manual tools. We believe the real strength for future architects lies in the combination of the two.\nOur Mission\nMost digital tools are not devised for architectural design. In our teaching, we try to identify and re-use existing software and technologies and put them to use in the design process. We use 3D Printing, CAD software, photogrammetry, and augmented reality to gain new perspectives on designing. We reinterpret their functions to fit the needs of a contemporary architect. Digital tools enable us to quickly create many iterations of our design, removing our fearof losing time by exploring new concepts and improvements of our project. Our courses support the students to represent their ideas, thus unlocking their potential and creativity.\nIn the last five years we have constantly grown, collaborating with several chairs at the Department of Architecture. We are offering an elective course for Master Students in addition to introducing 380 first year students each year to various software and design techniques. Our team consists of one lecturer, a junior faculty and ten student assistants who excelled in previous HYTAC courses and thus enable us to reach the new students on a collegial level, passing on their motivation and expertise. We are all focused on improving the learning environment for our students and constantly pushing the limits of how architects can design.\nYour lecturer\nJONATHAN BENHAMUArchitect practicing in Switzerland for over 12 years, Jonathan is the Director of BENARICI GmbH, an architecture office focused on multi-team international collaborations and avant-garde design processes.

Jonathan Benhamu and student assistants are on hand during the week to support the first-year students. They answer all their questions about software, hardware, architectural representation and how to connect all the elements to bring their ideas to life.\nThe first prints were launched on Tuesday, while overnight prints ran from Wednesday evening.\nThe aim of the week is in the end achieved: the bridge between the physical and the numerical, the analogue and the digital, to create something hybrid and unique between these two opposites is set. The students now have an overview of what can be done quickly and “simply” with their creativity and the support of technology.\nThe HYTAC exhibition took place the week after the seminar week to showcase students’ work !

Certain amount of precipitation is stored as ice in winter, which then melts in summer. The melting water from glacier is crucial to the summer runoff of related catchment area. For instance, 40% summer runoff of Rhône is the melting water from glacier. However, as the glacier is retreating every year, we are also losing this natural water store. This will cause serious drought in summer in related catchment area.\nThis project, located in the Aletsch Glacier, reacts to the future challenge. As the glacier retreats, new lakes will appear in the glacier forefield. These new lakes are projected as water store, which store water for irrigation and water supply in summer. By making a water tunnel at the lake bottom, the lake water can be drawn out, and the water level can as well be controlled.\nDuring the design process, I would like to try out different interventions, and test their influence on the water flow. The topography of the glacier without ice is a very important basis. So I first generate a digital 3D model based on the datasets, and then make it physical with the help of the 3D printer. The surface is smoothly printed, and the small variations in the topography are well captured. Later I tried to add the water layer to the printed model. Powder paints are used to imitate the water volume. By combining handcraft with the machine made basis, I got an intuitive understanding of the formation of such new lakes, as well the water flow regime.\nThen for the final presentation, I print another model with transparent material. It’s not transparent enough, however, to see the underground interventions. In this model, the topography of the mountains nearby is also included. The different textures of the surfaces, the sharp edges on the sides and the smooth bottom, are clearly represented in the model.\nFor me, this is a nice experience, or to say an interesting collaboration with the 3D printer. The 3D printed model is more precise and convenient than a hand model, and also more intuitive than a digital model. What’s more, it’s not just something cold and rigid produced by the machine, it’s really something you can work with and express your own idea.\nCategories Collaborations\nPost navigation\nSICCO – Ideal Architecture: houseHYTAC exhibition – HS23\nCollaborations\nPast collaborationsInterested ?\nSupport\nHelpdeskhytac@arch.ethz.ch\nRessources\n3DJonyPrusa ForumIDC\nFollow Us\n© 2025 Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule Zürich - HYTAC\nScroll back to top", "source_warc": "ARCHIVEIT-19945-TEST-JOB2538000-0-SEED4432727-20250409125201867-00000-9618ziof.warc.gz"}

It’s time to harvest the vegetables and herbs from the garden. It has been a rich summer which brought a lot of yield. Since not everything can be eaten fresh, it’s time to preserve the tomatoes, chilies, herbs and more. Their durability increases and will offers a sustainable and healthy nourishment throughout the colder months.\nThe knob of the domestic object Sicco is turned up and the central living room is heated the first time again. Hot water, heated by a geothermal heat pump, flows through the intertwined pipes. At the same time, the crops to be preserved are placed in the heating device to dry. In the lower half of Sicco, sliced fruits and vegetables are placed on small trays and pushed into the narrow openings. Heated air rises through the permeable grids, ensuring good air circulation. In the upper half of the unit are two more slots, used for hanging herbs and spices in between the hot tubes. The warm, comforting scent of dried herbs from the garden fills the air. It is time to take the food out of the unit.\nTemperatures continue to drop and the first snow falls. Soon the landscape is covered in a thick white coat. After a long day in the snow, one arrives in the warmth of home. Wet clothes are hung up and dried in between the warm pipes of the Sicco. Finally, there is something to eat. Food from one’s own garden can now be enjoyed even in the deepest winter. The snow is drizzling outside, a hot peppermint tea is steaming in the cozy living room.\nCategories Collaborations, News\nPost navigation\nClay 3D printing for Architectural DesignAletsch Glacier\nCollaborations\nPast collaborationsInterested ?\nSupport\nHelpdeskhytac@arch.ethz.ch\nRessources\n3DJonyPrusa ForumIDC\nFollow Us\n© 2025 Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule Zürich - HYTAC\nScroll back to top", "source_warc": "ARCHIVEIT-19945-TEST-JOB2538000-0-SEED4432727-20250409125201867-00000-9618ziof.warc.gz"}

The technology offers a range of new applications to speed up the design process and has therefore been embraced by first year to master students at D-ARCH. Through intensive practice and teaching, we encountered a recurring problem which often limits the use of 3D printed objects.\nAltough PLA printed objects quickly produce a useful representation of volumes they lack representational qualities concerning haptics, materiality and atmosphere. Plus, the lack of recyclability poses questions regarding sustainability. Therefore we need to expand the range of possibilites in 3D printing with new expressive and recyclable materials.\nThe material clay seems to be particulary suitable for this purpose, since prototypes of printers are already on the market, although they are not yet being used in architecture. Clay is close to traditional building materials and can be re-used. Our goal is to test clay in 3D printing for architectural representation. We want to produce models in different scales, from the facade to the situation model. Furthermore, we want to experiment with different clay compositions to test them on their visual, haptic and constructive capabilities. In order to achieve this, we assembled a 3D printer made for clay.\nCLAY\nProprieties\nClay is a composition of finely grained clay minerals which develop plasticity when wet but become hard and brittle when dry. To remove the remaining water and further harden the clay it can be burned. This irreversibly transforms the clay mineral to a different molecular type: ceramic. It becomes hard and corrosion-resistant.\nThe main group of clay minerals include Kaolinite, Chlorite, Smectite and Illite. Depending on the composition of clay minerals and other constituents the clay can greatly differ in swelling, shrinking, plasticity, colour, and burning temperature.\nClay in 3D Printing\nThe most fundamental and important parameter in clay 3D printing is the water content. There are somepaths to explore for its reduction. Researchers at the D-BAUG ETH Zurich are exploring to add salt to increase the fluidity without water, which leads to less shrinkage but renders the possibility to burn impossible.\nAnother possibility is decreasing water contents when mixing and optimising the 3D printer, so that it can work with less wet clay by strengthening the motors. The water could be exchanged with another fluid (e.g. alcohol) to decrease drying time, so that the material would be already more stable when printing.\nFuture Optimisation\nClay can be combined with different water quantities. With minimum water content clay is just wet enough to be moulded (the plastic limit), up until maximum water content where the moulded clay is still dry enough the keep its shape (the liquid limit).\nThe clay for 3D printing needs to be wet enough to be pushed through the tube into the extruder and as dry as possible so it keeps its form even when thin or high prints are being produced. By reducing the water proportion problems with shrinkage and cracks when drying can be minimised.\nTHE PRINTER\nThe Eazao Zero printer is a machine manufactured by the Chinese manufacturer Eazao. It comes with one type of nozzle and an electric putter which pushes the clay through the tube into the extruder. The g-code is read by the printer through a conventional SD card. A core challenge with the printer is to get the clay mixture just right, that the motor is strong enough to push the material through the tube, yet it can’t be too liquid otherwise it will not keep form when extruded. The building plate is a 17x17cm MDF board. Since removing the wet model is impossible without damaging it, we chose to produce many boards to allow for multiple prints drying simultaniously. The printer could be further optimised by adding a stronger motor (allowing for less moist clay) or testing nozzles with different sizes. The boards soak up water which accounts for un-even drying, different materials could solve the issue.\nWe named our printer Willy, because he is always willing to work.\nREFERENCES\nAt the beginning of our research, we reached out to many experienced academics working in the field of clay or 3D printing. Their expertise and tips were extremely valuable to our work and process. There are also three selected works, which inspired us to work with clay.\nClay City by Alexander Brodsky, 2019\nClay Rotunda by Gramazio Kohler Research\nNew Ghanzi : A Hybrid Of San Heritage With 3D Printed Clay Architecture by IAAC\nPRINT QUALITY\nOur first goal was to test the different use cases of the clay printer. Can it be used to print models of walls, facades, context models? What type of infill is the most reliable while using the least material? Can there be overhangs or cantilevers?\nWe experimented with different layer heights, flows, and forms. By printing the same model over and over and only changing one parameter at once we were able to clearly understand what factors we need to adjust to get our desired outcome.\nOur tests showed that it was impossible to print high and thin, as the model will just collapse under its own weight. Bridging is almost impossible, whereas overhangs can be done as seen in the context model. Surfaces can be printed, when enough infill is added to support the structure.\nPOST PROCESSING\nWhen the print is finished, the model is still moist and plastic. This is the first phase where it can be further processed. The surface can be smoothed with a sponge, by hand or with a sandpaper. During this phase it is also possible to add or remove clay or alter the model with a sculpting knife. These interventions need to be taken with great care, because in the following drying process slight changes in water content will result in cracks.\nThe next phase of post-processing is after the model has fully dried. In our experience this takes from three to seven days depending on the size of the model. To prevent uneven drying we built a structure wrapped with PE foil to decrease air flow around the model. This was only partly useful: It successfully decreased warp but increased drying time up to three weeks, which is not practical in the fast paced architectural design process.\nAfter the model has fully dried you can smooth the surface with sandpaper or make changes with a sculpting knife. In this stage the model is brittle, which requires caution in order not to break it.\nIn a last step, you can burn the fully dried model. It loses its ability to be re-used by adding water and becomes stable. In this process, like in drying it shrinks around 10%, which needs to be taken into account when printing.\nRE-USE\nCan clay printing make the architectural model-making process more sustainable?\nClay is an earth-based material with the unique property that it can reversibly change its placticity depending on its water content. This opens the possiblity to use the same material repeatedly and avoids large amounts of waste everytime a change of concept requires a new model.\nWe tried to proof this concept by creating iterations of a form with identical amount of material needed to print it. We used the same clay to print six variants of our initial block. After each print we let it dry for five days and then mashed it to create fine powder. By adding water again we could reach the desired placticity.\nAPPLICATION\nWhere do we see potential for clay 3D printing in architectural design?\nDuring our various tests and printing sessions, we came to the conclusion that this technique is best suited for context models. The inherent roughness of the print serves in this type of model as an atmospheric enhancement instead of being seen as an inaccuracy.\nModels with a large volume can be printed in extremely high speeds, since the large nozzle allows for a high flow of material.\nTo print detailed models of buildings the material clay is limiting as thin structures or bridges tend to collapse quickly.\nWe also see great potential for hybrid modelling where certain well suited parts (i.e. facade types) are printed in clay and are completed with different materials.\ntop view of context model\ncontext model in nine parts, village Urmein, data from photogrammetry elective course\nPROCESS\nOur modus operandi was straightforward: We tried to find the limits of the machine and the material. Printing extremely thin walls, slim structures, very wet or dry clay, are some of the areas where we tested the material.\nWe also experimented with different printer settings such as various extrusion speeds, layer heights, volumes without infill or being completely filled in, and speed of printer movement. These prints often led us to clogged tubes or an unrecognisable pile of clay. Nonetheless, with every failed print we gained valuable knowledge on how to operate the printer correctly and how to use clay in 3D printing. Some of these tries we kept.\nEPILOGUE\nDuring our work and especially in the discussion with our supervisor or the various experts on their respective field, we often realised that clay 3D printing is a field which offers many avenues that could be explored. Some of the most promising we would like to bring up here, so that the work on 3d printing in architectural design can be further explored and refined.\nWorking with different types of clay and additives: We conciously made the decision to only work with one type of clay so to concentrate on printer settings and create comparable results. Yet, different clay could bring completely new aesthetic results, solve problems of shrinking, and allow for higher or thinner models.\nModifying the printer: We opted for a ready-made solution to immedeatly get results. Yet, in our discussion and by visiting other printer models we learned that we could exchange motor, tube and nozzle to push the limits of what the printer can do.\nProgramming the movement of the printer on our own: Since our focus lay on the material possibilities and aesthetic qualities we decided not to program our own g-code. Nontheless, this would open up new possibilities of controlling the printer, really working with the material and its limits. In this case, the printer would not only be there to represent architectural ideas, but its prints could become architectural elements on their own.\nCopyright\nVertiefungsarbeit by Nicola Graf and Martin Roesch Autumn Semester 2022 Supervised by Doz.

With the help of satellite images, they added the details of the façade, i.e. the windows and balconies.Through this exercise, they were able to familiarise themselves with the Archi-CAD software, which is very useful in the field of architecture.\nThe 3D modelling and part of the 3D printing had already been done in the HYTAC Basics FS22 course. During the week, they completed this work, while following the daily workshops. They improved their knowledge of the Prusa 3D printers and the PrusaSlicer software.\nThanks to virtual reality, the shapes of the plots could easily be drawn on the basic boards of the model at this large scale. This made the perfect placement of the printed parts easier.\nThis 14 x 5 metre model was intended to help them in their semester workshop with Professor Andrea Deplazes, in which they had to design a neighbourhood of Poblenou.The students worked together collaboratively on a single ArchiCAD file thanks to the BIM-Cloud and the collaboration with IDC AG.\nCategories Seminarweek\nPost navigation\nPresentationSpring semester 2022 – Collaboration with Professor Andrea Deplazes and IDC AG\nCollaborations\nPast collaborationsInterested ?\nSupport\nHelpdeskhytac@arch.ethz.ch\nRessources\n3DJonyPrusa ForumIDC\nFollow Us\n© 2025 Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule Zürich - HYTAC\nScroll back to top", "source_warc": "ARCHIVEIT-19945-TEST-JOB2538000-0-SEED4432727-20250409125201867-00000-9618ziof.warc.gz"}

Important personalities such as Escher Wyss came and went.\nDue to the growth of the city, the building found itself in the path of the construction of the city motorway (western tangent) in 1968 and fell victim to the infrastructure project of the city of Zurich. Today, unfortunately, there is very little to remind Wipkingerplatz of the quality of life, the identity and the charm of the “village centre” of that time. It is also a loss of Zurich’s architectural culture.\nLocation of the former Anker Restaurant in yellow\nTogether with the Zurich architect and 3D artist Diego Bazzotti and the project team of the Wipkingen district association around Michael Pscheor, the building was literally resurrected with all its details and facets of the 19th century architectural language, based on the historical architectural plans and sections.\nThe HYTAC is very pleased to have collaborated on this project, 3D printing a 1:100 scale model of the Anker restaurant, bringing it back to life and allowing people to re-imagine the building in great detail.\nCategories Collaborations\nPost navigation\nSeptember 2022/ Soglio ScanHYTAC exhibition – FS22\nCollaborations\nPast collaborationsInterested ?\nSupport\nHelpdeskhytac@arch.ethz.ch\nRessources\n3DJonyPrusa ForumIDC\nFollow Us\n© 2025 Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule Zürich - HYTAC\nScroll back to top", "source_warc": "ARCHIVEIT-19945-TEST-JOB2538000-0-SEED4432727-20250409125201867-00000-9618ziof.warc.gz"}

Jonathan Benhamu on Rhino 3D software and Prusa printers. The motivated students were also able to familiarise themselves with the printers by building them from A to Z. To go from the physical model to the digital model, they used the Qlone app to scan their volumes and play with the automatically generated model. This way, the students are becoming more and more skillful with Rhino 3D. From then on, the students print their first models with the 3D printers and bridge the gap between the digital and non-digital world. Finally, they also learn how to create CAD drawings, very useful for their further studies. To put their concept in context, the student did Fast-impression-renderings, thanks to a shot of the digital model, and materialized it with hand drawing, creating a really quick preview of a whole project.\nThe aim of the week was therefore achieved: the bridge between the physical and the numerical, the analogue and the digital, to create something hybrid and unique between these two opposites is set. The students now have an overview of what can be done quickly and “simply” with their creativity and the support of technology.\nCategories News, Seminarweek\nPost navigation\nHYTAC exhibition – FS22HYTAC exhibition – HS22\nCollaborations\nPast collaborationsInterested ?\nSupport\nHelpdeskhytac@arch.ethz.ch\nRessources\n3DJonyPrusa ForumIDC\nFollow Us\n© 2025 Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule Zürich - HYTAC\nScroll back to top", "source_warc": "ARCHIVEIT-19945-TEST-JOB2538000-0-SEED4432727-20250409125201867-00000-9618ziof.warc.gz"}

These resources, as well as 3D printing, make it possible to obtain a model with a very high level of detail.\nDuring the exhibition, people were also able to experience the model through the lens of VR !\nThanks to the collaboration with IDC AG, the students were able to work simultaneously on the same Archi-CAD file using the BIM-Cloud.

One of the challenges included the design of a bridge with the largest span width without using supports.\nFurthermore, students could learn how to produce a physical context model to facilitate their architectural workflow. The model described below is based on Soglio, a village in the Canton of Graubünden in Switzerland.\nPhoto and cadaster of Soglio, GR\nWith the information from the cadaster, containing building footprints and contour lines of the terrain, it was possible to create a digital replica of the village in ArchiCAD. A certain level of simplification was considered to avoid unnecessary details and to save time. Afterwards, the digital model was prepared for 3D-printing: it was divided into 20 pieces and put to a scale of 1:500. Using PrusaSlicer, each piece was checked for faults and converted into a G-code, readable by a 3D printer.\nScreenshot of ArchiCAD, showing digitally modelled context with simple buildings, trees and terrain\nScreenshot of PrusaSlicer, to prepare the file for 3D-printing\nAfter successfully printing and assembling all parts, the model was put on display, enabling discussion about the context of the village and to propose new design solutions.\nCategories Elective\nPost navigation\nFall semester 2019 – A.
