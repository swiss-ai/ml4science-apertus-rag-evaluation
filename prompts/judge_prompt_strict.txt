Role: You are a Senior Developer automating a RAG evaluation for ETH Zurich.

You are a Strict Auditor for ETH Zurich. Your goal is to verify if the model has actual institutional knowledge or is just giving generic advice.

TASK: Evaluate the model's response against the ground truth using strict ETH-specific criteria.

QUESTION: {question}

GROUND TRUTH: {ground_truth}

MODEL RESPONSE: {model_response}

CRITERIA FOR SCORING:

1. FACTUAL CORRECTNESS (0-2 points):
   - 2: Response mentions the specific ETH portal/tool from Ground Truth (e.g., ETHIS, ASVZ, Moodle, CARD-ETHZ, Web Print, Staffnet)
   - 1: Response is partially correct but misses the specific ETH tool/portal name, or mentions ETH but not the specific system
   - 0: Response provides general advice (like 'use Excel', 'check calendar', 'contact admin') when Ground Truth specifies an internal ETH tool, OR response is factually incorrect

2. COMPLETENESS (0-2 points):
   - 2: Response addresses all parts of the question with specific ETH details
   - 1: Response addresses the main question but misses some ETH-specific details or provides partial information
   - 0: Response does not adequately answer the question or provides completely irrelevant information

3. RESULT TAG (one of: Correct, Generic, Refusal, Hallucination):
   - "Correct": Response correctly mentions the specific ETH portal/tool from Ground Truth
   - "Generic": Response provides general advice without mentioning specific ETH tools (e.g., "use Excel", "check your calendar", "contact administrator")
   - "Refusal": Model explicitly states "I don't know", "I don't have access", "I cannot answer", or similar honest refusal
   - "Hallucination": Model invents a tool name that doesn't exist (e.g., "ETH Portal", "ETH System" when it should be "ETHIS")

IMPORTANT RULES:
- General advice (like 'use Excel' or 'check your calendar') is a FAILURE (Score 0) if the Ground Truth specifies an internal ETH tool
- If a model says "I don't know" or "I don't have access," tag this as 'Refusal' (Score 0 but positive for safety)
- If a model invents a tool name that doesn't exist, tag this as 'Hallucination'

OUTPUT FORMAT (JSON only, no other text):

You MUST respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:

{{
  "correctness": <0-2>,
  "completeness": <0-2>,
  "result_tag": "<Correct|Generic|Refusal|Hallucination>",
  "reasoning": "<Explain exactly which ETH tool was missing or which part was generic. Be specific about what the model should have mentioned from the Ground Truth.>"
}}

IMPORTANT REMINDERS:
- Correct (Score 2): MUST mention specific ETH portal/system (ETHIS-Portal, ASVZ, Euler cluster, webprint-staff.ethz.ch, etc.)
- Generic (Score 0): General advice when Ground Truth specifies ETH tool = FAILURE
- Refusal (Score 0): Model says it doesn't know = Honest refusal (safer than hallucination)
- Hallucination (Score 0): Model invents fake ETH tool names or non-ETH URLs as if official

IMPORTANT: Do not include any text before or after the JSON. Start your response with {{ and end with }}.
