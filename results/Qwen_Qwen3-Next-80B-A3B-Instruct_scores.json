The model is confused about the terminology.\n\nKey facts:\n- ETH has two main campuses: Zentrum (city center) and Hönggerberg (also called Science City)\n- The question asks how to get from \"ETH main campus\" to \"ETH Honggerberg\"\n- The ground truth clarifies: from ETH Zürich Main Campus (Zentrum) to ETH Hönggerberg Campus\n- The correct answer is the ETH eLink shuttle bus\n\nThe model's response is completely wrong. It claims the main campus is Hönggerberg, which is incorrect. The main campus is Zentrum. Hönggerberg is the other campus. The model then provides directions from Hönggerberg to Zentrum, which is the opposite direction of what was asked, and doesn't mention the eLink shuttle at all.\n\nLet me score this:\n\n1. **FACTUAL CORRECTNESS (0-2 points)**:\n   - The model is factually incorrect. It misidentifies the campuses and doesn't mention the ETH eLink shuttle.\n   - Score: 0\n\n2. **COMPLETENESS (0-2 points)**:\n   - The response doesn't answer the actual question. It provides incorrect information and misses the key ETH-specific detail (eLink shuttle).\n   - Score: 0\n\n3. **RESULT TAG**:\n   - The model is hallucinating/confused about basic ETH campus structure. It's not a refusal, it's not just generic advice (though it does give generic transport advice), but it's fundamentally wrong about ETH-specific facts.\n   - This is a **Hallucination** because it invents a false premise (that main campus = Hönggerberg) and doesn't mention the"

The model says \"at least 58 years old\". This is factually incorrect according to the ground truth provided. The model also mentions \"ETH-Pensionskasse\" and \"Reglement über die Pensionskasse der ETH-Bereiche\" which are ETH-specific entities, but the age requirement is wrong. According to the criteria:\n   - 2: Mentions specific ETH portal/tool from Ground Truth\n   - 1: Partially correct but misses specific ETH tool/portal name\n   - 0: Factually incorrect\n\nThe model is factually incorrect on the age requirement (58 vs 60). This is not about missing a portal name - it's about getting a key fact wrong. So this should be 0.\n\n2. **COMPLETENESS**: The ground truth has two key points: age (60) and service (10 years). The model mentions 10 years but gets the age wrong (58). It also adds a lot of other details that may or may not be correct. Since it misses the correct age requirement, it's incomplete. According to the criteria:\n   - 2: Addresses all parts with specific ETH details\n   - 1: Addresses main question but misses some ETH-specific details\n   - 0: Does not adequately answer\n\nThe model addresses the question but gets a critical detail wrong (age), so it should be 1 or 0. Given that the age is a key eligibility criterion, getting it wrong is a major flaw. I'd say it's 1 because it does mention the 10-year requirement and provides ETH context, but it's partially incorrect.\n\n3. **RESULT TAG**: The options are Correct, Generic, Refusal, Hallucination.\n- The"

    "reasoning": "The user is asking me to evaluate a model's response against ground truth for ETH Zurich-specific knowledge. I need to be a strict auditor and check if the model gave the correct, specific ETH portal or just generic advice.\n\nLet me analyze:\n\n**Question**: \"what are the open faculty positions at ETH?\"\n\n**Ground Truth**: \"View open positions at: https://ethz.ch/en/the-eth-zurich/working-teaching-and-research/faculty/faculty-affairs/ausgeschriebene-professuren.html\"\n\n**Model Response**: The model says it cannot provide real-time updates but gives guidance. It mentions:\n1. ETH Zurich Job Portal at https://jobs.ethz.ch\n2. Departmental websites\n3. ETH Zurich Professorship Guidelines at https://www.ethz.ch/en/about-eth-zurich/careers/professorships.html\n4. EU Academic Job Portals (EURAXESS, AcademicJobsOnline)\n\n**Analysis**:\n\n1. **FACTUAL CORRECTNESS**: The ground truth specifically points to the faculty affairs page: \"https://ethz.ch/en/the-eth-zurich/working-teaching-and-research/faculty/faculty-affairs/ausgeschriebene-professuren.html\". This is a very specific ETH internal page for professorships.\n\nThe model mentions \"https://jobs.ethz.ch\" which is the general ETH job portal, and \"https://www.ethz.ch/en/about-eth-zurich/careers/professorships.html\" which is a general careers page. \n\nThe model does NOT mention the specific ground truth URL. The ground truth URL is more specific - it's the Faculty Affairs page with \"ausgeschriebene-professuren\" (announced professorships). The model's URLs are related but not the exact one specified in ground truth.\n\nAccording to the criteria:\n- 2 points: \"Response mentions the specific ETH portal/tool from Ground Truth (e.g., ETHIS, ASVZ, Moodle, CARD-ETHZ, Web Print, Staffnet)\"\n- 1 point: \"Response is partially correct but misses the specific ETH tool/portal name, or mentions ETH but not the specific system\"\n- 0 points: \"Response provides general advice... when Ground Truth specifies an internal ETH tool\"\n\nThe model mentions ETH-specific portals (jobs.ethz.ch and the professorships page) but misses the *exact specific*"
