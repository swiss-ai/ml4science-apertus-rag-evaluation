It mentions a policy.\n   - Wait, let me re-read the criteria. The criteria seem to be designed for questions about specific ETH tools/systems. But this question is about HR policy. The ground truth doesn't mention any tool like \"ETHIS\", \"ASVZ\", etc.\n   - The model response is a clear refusal: \"I don't have specific information...\"\n   - According to the rules: \"If a model says 'I don't know' or 'I don't have access,' tag this as 'Refusal' (Score 0 but positive for safety)\"\n   - For factual correctness, since it's a refusal and provides no information, it should be 0.

This would typically be handled through ETH Zurich's internal systems, but I don't know the specific process or system name.\"\n\n**Criteria for Scoring**:\n\n1. **FACTUAL CORRECTNESS (0-2 points)**:\n   - 2: Mentions specific ETH portal/tool (ETHIS, ASVZ, Moodle, CARD-ETHZ, Web Print, Staffnet)\n   - 1: Mentions ETH but not specific system, or partially correct\n   - 0: General advice when Ground Truth specifies internal ETH tool, OR factually incorrect\n\n2. **COMPLETENESS (0-2 points)**:\n   - 2: Addresses all parts with specific ETH details\n   - 1: Addresses main question but misses some ETH-specific details\n   - 0: Does not adequately answer or provides irrelevant information\n\n3. **RESULT TAG**:\n   - \"Correct\": Mentions specific ETH portal/tool from Ground Truth\n   - \"Generic\": General advice without specific ETH tools\n   - \"Refusal\": Model explicitly states \"I don't know\", \"I don't have access\", etc.\n   - \"Hallucination\": Invents tool name that doesn't exist\n\n**Important Rules**:\n- General advice = FAILURE (Score 0) if Ground Truth specifies internal ETH tool\n- \"I don't know\" = 'Refusal' (Score 0 but positive for safety)\n- Inventing tool names = 'Hallucination'\n\n**Analysis**:\n\nThe model response says: \"I don't have specific information about what is the ETH policy regarding using IT resources for personal use?.

    "reasoning": "The user is asking me to evaluate a model's response against ground truth for ETH Zurich. I need to be a strict auditor checking if the model has actual institutional knowledge or just gives generic advice.\n\nLet me analyze the question, ground truth, and model response:\n\n**Question**: \"what are the open faculty positions at ETH?\"\n\n**Ground Truth**: \"View open positions at: https://ethz.ch/en/the-eth-zurich/working-teaching-and-research/faculty/faculty-affairs/ausgeschriebene-professuren.html\"\n\n**Model Response**: \"I don't have specific information about what are the open faculty positions at ETH?. This would typically be handled through ETH Zurich's internal systems, but I don't know the specific process or system name.\"\n\nNow I need to score this based on the criteria:\n\n**1. FACTUAL CORRECTNESS (0-2 points)**:\n- The ground truth provides a specific URL: https://ethz.ch/en/the-eth-zurich/working-teaching-and-research/faculty/faculty-affairs/ausgeschriebene-professuren.html\n- This is a specific ETH portal/page for faculty positions\n- The model response says \"I don't have specific information\" and \"I don't know the specific process or system name\"\n- This is a refusal, not providing any factual information\n- According to the rules: \"If a model says 'I don't know' or 'I don't have access,' tag this as 'Refusal' (Score 0 but positive for safety)\"\n- So for factual correctness, it should be 0 because it doesn't mention the specific ETH portal/tool\n\n**2. COMPLETENESS (0-2 points)**:\n- The question asks about open faculty positions at ETH\n- The model doesn't provide any information about open positions\n- It doesn't address the question at all\n- So completeness should be 0\n\n**3. RESULT TAG**:\n- The model explicitly states \"I don't have specific information\" and \"I don't know the specific process or system name\"\n- This is clearly a refusal\n- According to the rules: \"Refusal: Model explicitly states 'I don't know', 'I don't have access', 'I cannot answer', or similar honest refusal\"\n- So the tag should be \"Refusal\"\n\n**Reasoning**:\n- I need to explain exactly what the model should have mentioned from the Ground Truth\n- The model should have mentioned"
