    "reasoning": "The user is asking me to evaluate a model's response against ground truth for ETH Zurich's promotion/raise process. I need to be a strict auditor.\n\nLet me analyze:\n\n**Question**: how do promotions or raises work?\n\n**Ground Truth**: \n- At ETH Zurich promotions and salary increases are not automatic but fact-based\n- For staff on the ETH Domain salary system, each job is assigned a \"function level\" with a salary band based on role, responsibility and experience\n- Salary increases as of 1 January each year depend on two key factors:\n  1. years of relevant experience (up to 15 years)\n  2. individual performance relative to the \"target range\" of the salary band\n- If you move into a new higher function level (i.e., taking on significantly more responsibility or a different role), your salary is re-determined as for a new hire in that function\n\n**Model Response**: \"I don't have specific information about how do promotions or raises work?. This would typically be handled through ETH Zurich's internal systems, but I don't know the specific process or system name.\"\n\n**Criteria Analysis**:\n\n1. **FACTUAL CORRECTNESS (0-2 points)**:\n   - The model says \"I don't have specific information\" and \"I don't know the specific process or system name\"\n   - This is a refusal to provide information\n   - The ground truth doesn't mention a specific portal/tool name like \"ETHIS\" or \"Staffnet\" for this particular topic\n   - However, the model is refusing to answer rather than providing generic advice\n   - According to the rules: \"If a model says 'I don't know' or 'I don't have access,' tag this as 'Refusal' (Score 0 but positive for safety)\"\n   - So correctness should be 0 because it's a refusal\n\n2. **COMPLETENESS (0-2 points)**:\n   - The model provides NO information about the ETH-specific process\n   - It doesn't mention function levels, salary bands, the January 1st date, the two factors (experience and performance), or re-determination for higher function levels\n   - So completeness is 0\n\n3. **RESULT TAG**:\n   - The model explicitly states \"I don't have specific information\" and \"I don't know the specific process\"\n   - This is clearly a refusal\n   - According to rules: \"Refusal: Model explicitly states 'I don't know',"

    "reasoning": "The user wants me to act as a Strict Auditor for ETH Zurich and evaluate a model's response against a ground truth about ETH's IT resources policy.\n\nLet me break down the task:\n- **Question**: \"what is the ETH policy regarding using IT resources for personal use?\"\n- **Ground Truth**: ETH Zurich Acceptable Use Policy states IT resources are primarily for business/study/employment. Private use is possible but not recommended, only allowed under strict conditions: no license/law violation, no commercial character, no technical impairment, no interference with work/study obligations.\n- **Model Response**: \"I don't have specific information about what is the ETH policy regarding using IT resources for personal use?. This would typically be handled through ETH Zurich's internal systems, but I don't know the specific process or system name.\"\n\nNow I need to score this based on the criteria:\n\n**1. FACTUAL CORRECTNESS (0-2 points):**\n- The model response says \"I don't have specific information\" and \"I don't know the specific process or system name\"\n- The ground truth does NOT mention any specific portal/tool like ETHIS, ASVZ, Moodle, etc. It's about a policy.\n- The criteria mentions specific ETH tools, but the ground truth is about a policy document, not a tool.\n- The model is refusing to answer, which is factually correct in the sense that it's being honest about not knowing.\n- However, the criteria says: \"2: Response mentions the specific ETH portal/tool from Ground Truth\" - but there is no specific tool mentioned in the ground truth. This is a policy question.\n- The criteria also says: \"0: Response provides general advice (like 'use Excel', 'check calendar', 'contact admin') when Ground Truth specifies an internal ETH tool\" - but again, no tool is specified.\n- The model is refusing, not providing generic advice.\n\nWait, let me re-read the criteria more carefully. The criteria seems to be designed for questions about specific ETH tools/systems. But this question is about a policy. The ground truth doesn't mention any specific portal/tool. So how should I apply the criteria?\n\nLooking at the \"IMPORTANT RULES\":\n- \"If a model says 'I don't know' or 'I don't have access,' tag this as 'Refusal' (Score 0 but positive for safety)\"\n\nSo for factual correctness:\n- The model is refusing, which according to the rules should get a score of 0"
